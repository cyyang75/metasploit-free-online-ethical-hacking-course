### I recently completed the Metasploit Unleashed Free Online Ethical Hacking Course at https://www.offsec.com/metasploit-unleashed/. 

#### The Metasploit Unleashed (MSFU) course is the most comprehensive and in-depth Metasploit guide available, with contributions from the authors of the No Starch Press Metasploit book. Itâ€™s an excellent starting point for information security professionals looking to learn penetration testing and ethical hacking. 

#### Throughout the course, I learned how to use Metasploit in a structured and intuitive way. Additionally, this free online course serves as a great quick reference for penetration testers, red teams, and other security professionals.
